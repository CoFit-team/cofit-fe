## Introduction

The need to prioritize mental health has been made more pertinent with the global COVID19 pandemic and the social distancing or isolation policies. On this note, we aim to build a social diary where people are able to share their thoughts online via different mediums like text and images. What we want to do is also be able to pinpoint cases or trends of people experiencing a valley in their lives so that the necessary help and support can be rendered.
